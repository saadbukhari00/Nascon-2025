  I was scammed online and began tracking the scammer’s location. I successfully identified his city and later discovered a crucial clue: he works at a hospital and frequently visits two restaurants. When he has little money, he eats at a small, budget-friendly restaurant, but after receiving his salary, he dines at a more expensive restaurant. These two restaurants are located near each other.

To gather more intelligence, I sent a detective to the area, but he was captured. Before losing contact, he managed to send a single image of the small restaurant—without any direct hints. While on a call with him, I could hear the sound of water in the background, suggesting that the restaurant is near a river. Acting quickly, I had my satellite team capture an image of the location, which confirmed that the area is by a riverside.

One final clue: the small restaurant’s name is inspired by a lake, and its name is visibly written on its wall. Using this information, You need to identify the hospital in which he works , the other restaurant name , nearest train station(The station maybe a junction , if it is write it as ( <name of station>Junction).
